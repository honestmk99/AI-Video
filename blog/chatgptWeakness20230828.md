## GPT Weaknesses in Answering Property-Related Questions

When it comes to answering property-related questions, ChatGPT has its limitations:

- **Limited Context Understanding:** ChatGPT may sometimes lack context awareness, leading to answers that overlook specific property details or local regulations crucial for accurate responses.

- **Inaccurate Legal Advice:** While ChatGPT is a powerful tool, it's not a substitute for legal professionals. It can't provide tailored legal advice for specific property-related legal matters, which can result in incomplete or incorrect answers regarding legal concerns.

- **Outdated Information:** GPT-3's knowledge is based on data up to September 2021. This means it might lack information on recent property market developments, regulations, or trends.

- **Ambiguity Handling:** Ambiguous queries can be challenging for ChatGPT. Property-related questions might be vague or require clarification, leading to less precise responses.

- **Overly General Answers:** While aiming to provide broad answers, ChatGPT might generate responses lacking specific details. Property inquiries often necessitate precise information.

- **Privacy Concerns:** Handling questions involving sensitive property information, such as tenant records or financial details, raises privacy and security concerns.

- **Biased Information:** Like all language models, GPT-3 can inadvertently produce biased or discriminatory content if exposed to biased training data.

- **Lack of Personalized Advice:** ChatGPT can't offer personalized recommendations based on individual circumstances. Property-related decisions frequently demand personalized advice.

- **Difficulty with Local Specifics:** Property matters often hinge on local or regional factors. ChatGPT might lack access to location-specific data, resulting in non-location-specific answers.

- **Absence of Real-Time Data:** GPT-3 lacks access to real-time data sources, making it unable to provide current property listings, market prices, or availability status.

- **Misinterpretation:** Misinterpreted queries can lead to answers unrelated to the intended question.

- **Lack of Emotional Intelligence:** ChatGPT lacks emotional intelligence, so it might struggle to adequately address emotionally charged property disputes or conflicts.

- **Difficulty with Technical Details:** For highly technical property-related questions, such as construction or architectural queries, GPT-3 may lack the specialized knowledge needed for accurate responses.

- **Risk Assessment:** It might not accurately assess the risks associated with property decisions, like investment or purchasing choices.
